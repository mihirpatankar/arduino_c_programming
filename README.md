# Arduino C Programming

Here we will be using the Arduino IDE to program the board using C. The library functions such as pinMode, digitalWrite, etc use C functions underneath which we will try to explore. We will still be using the Arduino IDE to upload the program to the board which uses avrdude. We will try to go through a series of tutorials with increasing difficulty.

## Tutorial 1 : LED Blink
Here we will be using the General purpose I/O pins and configuring them to be an output and writing data to it. We setup an external LED which will be driven by the GPIO pin.

## Tutorial 2 : LED Switch
Here we will use digital inputs as well as outputs. We setup an external switch and LED. When the switch is pressed the LED turns off and vice versa.
