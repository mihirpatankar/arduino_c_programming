/*
DESCRIPTION :

Timer/Counter0 (TC0) is a general purpose 8-bit Timer/Counter module, with two independent Output Compare Units, and PWM support. It allows accurate program execution timing (event management) and wave generation.

The TC0 is enabled by writing the PRTIM0 bit in ”Minimizing Power Consumption” to '0'.

The TC0 is enabled when the PRTIM0 bit in the Power Reduction Register (PRR.PRTIM0) is written to '1'.
